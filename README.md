# Tour-Guide-App
This is a code repository for mumbai Tour Guide App for Mumbai city

We started with creating 4 new activities apart from MainActivity which are AttractionsActivity, RestaurantsActivity, StreetFoodActivity, and ShoppingActivity, all 4 activities are divided into sections and are described in the following section:

* Attractions: shows the different attractions in Mumbai city.
* Restaurants: shows the top restaurants in Mumbai city.
* StreetFood: shows the best street food available in Mumbai.
* Shopping: shows the best places to visit for shopping in Mumbai city. 

Following is the screenshot of how the MainActivity looks like:

It starts with the use of activities in the app. The app continues with a connecting concept called as intents.

Next, the app uses onCLickListners to know the behavior of the app when a user clicks on a specific element.

Further, the app uses ArrayLists to accept strings from the user. ArrayList is a powerful concept in Java which can be used for multiple purposes.

Next, the app also uses concepts of Loops in Java, where if-else loops and for loops are used in the app.

Further, the app introduces a concept of how to properly utilize resources(memory) of an android phone so that the app consumes minimal resources and helps the Android phone to work smoothly.

Then we used ListView so that we can display multiple text views at same time. ListViews uses a concept of view recycling which helps the app to consume less memory.

Also, we used a concept of ArrayAdapter combined with ListView so that we can optimize our app with respect to memory.

Further, the app also uses a concept of adding multiple images into the app. For example, the RestaurantsActivity shows the images of different restaurants.

Please refer the following screenshot of RestaurantsActivity to understand how images look in Tour Guide App:

Also, we learned about touch feedback in android which gives a ripple effect feedback to the user when the user clicks on a particular item.

Further, we converted our app from activities into fragments for a smoother experience.

The app looked like this when the fragment was added:

We used Navigation Patterns for adding the swipe effect to all the fragments which help the user to easily navigate through different fragments.

These are the screenshots of how the final app looks like:
